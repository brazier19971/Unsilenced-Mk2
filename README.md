UNSILENCED MK2 
Sky EPG Music simulation 

In January 2018, Sky discontinued the broadcast of their long standing EPG music service for older, OpenTV-based STBs.
This is intended to be a small C# utility to simulate the EPG background audio.

This is achieved through the use of the present Sky Gnome protocol, more information can be found at https://www.dusky-control.com/gnome-protocol.shtml

REQUIRED EQUIPMENT:
- OpenTV-based Sky STB (Software 3.3a.6-3.8.8 or Sky+1.30.n-5.08.6)
- RS-232 connection
- Method to mix audio to TV/display
- An audio file
